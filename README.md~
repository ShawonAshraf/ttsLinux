    #A very Simple Text To Speech for Linux


    A simple text to speech program
    for computers running on linux.
    This program uses espeak to convert
    text to speech.

    You can install espeak in ubuntu by typing the
    following command in the terminal

    sudo apt-get install espeak

    However this has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04.
    You can check on other distros as well.
    Feel free to use the code and make any improvements
    you want. :D
